### Project details

Building a chat based tool using Golang that utilises websockets and htmx.
I want this to be able to store message, and be extensible to an LLM structure of sorts.

Steps:
- Create project + set up
- set up web server for the basic UI & HTMX
- implement websockets for conversations
- implement storage system (postgres)
